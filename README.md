BMI Calculator is a simple and user-friendly Android application that allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) quickly. By entering height and weight, the app provides an instant BMI result along with a health category (e.g., Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese) to help users understand their body health status.
